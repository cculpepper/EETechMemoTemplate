\newsection{Abstract}
The purpose of this exercise was to learn more about the use of MOSFETs as current sources in order to supplement theory learned in class. 
MOSFET Current sources are used extensively in amplifier circuits to provide bias current. 
Two amplifier circuits were created and analyzed under varying loads, in order to characterize their responses. 
The data was analyzed and found to be <TODO>
