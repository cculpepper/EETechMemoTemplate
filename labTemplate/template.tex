\newsection{Abstract}
This is a paragraph. use a double backslash to start a new one. \\
like that. (In the tex document)
\newsection{Theory}

The circuit used for this exercise is shown in figure \ref{fig:cir}. 
\nimg[width=6in]{fig:cir}{circuit.png}{Basic Amplifier Circuit}
That is an image with an included reference. Using references will make it easy.
%Latex can have comments too!!!!!!!
Below are equations. Note that math mode doesnt need to be entered for the actual equation. 
Argument format is reference, equation and the caption. 
\eq{eq:ad}{
	A_d = (frac{v_o}{v_{diff}}) = g_m(r_{o2}||r_{o4}||R_L)}{
	Equation for the Calculation of the Differential Gain}
\eq{eq:acm}{
	A_{CM} = (\frac{v_o}{v_{cm}}) \approx - \frac{1}{2g_{m3}R_o}}{
	Equation for the Calculation of the Common Mode Gain}
	
\newsection{Results}
THis is how a new section is made. 

Speaking of making, provided is a makefile that will run latex the appropriate number of times and refresh the pdf viewer. 
\\
I use this in arch linux and need xpdf, texstudio and make installed. I have the editor open in one tab and make running an another. When I write, it refreshes the pdf. 
\newsection{Conclusion}
An appendix can be added the same way.
